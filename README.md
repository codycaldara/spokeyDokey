what shane did on sunday 3/26 - changed layout to dashboard style.
                           downloaded logo and placed in project folder under bh-logo.jpg
                           added collapse sidebar for storing rim brand names. <--- maybe add A-Z groups that have sub groups of brand names? so Brands > C > Cannondale etc.
                           tried to use dodger blue for shop color theme
                           made sidebar scroll independently from main page when content requires
                           made sidebar dissapear on smaller screens
                           
                           Ideas:
                           later in the class we're supposed to learn about routing, which would allow us to make this a single page application, otherwise we would have to create an entirely new page each time we clicked on a brand name. 
                           make a landing/login page and hookup firebase for authentication?

                           Joke: why do bewbz have nipples?
                           Because without them, they'd be pointless.
